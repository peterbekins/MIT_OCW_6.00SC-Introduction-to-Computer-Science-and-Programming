This project applies k-means clustering to a set of census data for US counties. First, it demonstrates the relationship 
between k-value and the sum of squared error between each point and the centroid of its cluster. Second, k-means clustering
for a set of train data is used to predict a feature (poverty level) for points within the test data. Third, feature 
selection is used to reduce the sum of squared error for the predicted values.
