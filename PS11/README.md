This project demonstrates optimization (shortest path) for a weighted digraph. The data for the graph concists of a set 
of buildings on the MIT campus (the nodes) and paths between buildings (the edges) weighted for both total distance and 
distance spent outdoors. Optimizations are run on a vaiety of constraints related to the max total distance and the max
distance spent outdoors.
