This project invovles encoding and decoding messages using a Caesar cipher. The simplistic decoding algorithm runs by brute force.
Each possible shift is attempted with the result checked against a list of all possible words to determine whether it was successful. 
If the result includes non-words, then attempt the next shift. The ultimate problem was to decode a fable to which multiple successive 
shifts had been applied.
