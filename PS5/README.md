This project involved the creation of a RSS Feed Filter that pulls stories based on a set of triggers.

The main file with my new code is rssfilter.py. 
The triggers are stored in triggers.txt
The other files--feedparser.py, project_util.py, and news_gui.py--were provided along with the skeleton code and instructions.
