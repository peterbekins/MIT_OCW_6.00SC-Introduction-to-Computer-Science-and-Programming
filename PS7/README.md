This project simulates a virus population within a human patient. For each time step, the virus is assigned a probability that it will
reproduce and a probability that it will clear from the patient's body. There is also a limit on the maximum population of viruses that
a patient can sustain. The program runs several trials of the simulation and plots the average virus population at each time step. 

Note that the next problem set will extend the model by adding treatment with drugs and drug-resistant viruses.
