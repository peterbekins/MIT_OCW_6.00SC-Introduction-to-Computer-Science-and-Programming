This project selects a set of college courses from a list with the goal of optimizing the course value while limiting the
required course work. A list of courses is supplied in the file subjects.txt. Each course is on a new line with the format: 
name, value, work. The course value is optimized using both a Greedy optimization and a brute force approach, then the two 
methods are compared.
